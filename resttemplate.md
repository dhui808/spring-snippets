### exchange vs execute vs postForEntity
    exchange: much more convenient than execute methods
      Can pass an HttpEntity directly, whereas in execute it needed to be set manually using the RequestCallback.
      Deserialization mechanics are provided out of the box by passing the desired response type Class, instead of using ResponseExtractor.
    postForEntity: calls execute themselves under the hood - it's simply a matter of convenience
