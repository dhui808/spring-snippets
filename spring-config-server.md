### Override Configuration in Spring Config Server with Local Configuration
    If you want to allow your applications to override the remote properties with their own System properties
    or config files, set spring.cloud.config.allowOverride=true (it doesnâ€™t work to set this locally). See
[Spring Cloud](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud.html)
