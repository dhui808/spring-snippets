### Types of Dependency Injection Configurations. 
  There are two different ways of Dependency Injection Configurations.

    XML based Configuration
    Java Annotation-based Configurations

### Different ways of Dependency Injection
  Constructor based Dependency Injection: @Autowired is used on top of the class constructor
    
  Setter based Dependency Injection: @Autowired is used on top of the classâ€™s setter method
  Field or Property-based Dependency Injection: @Autowired is used on top of the field or property in the class
  
  @Primary annotation: Gives priority to the other beans of the same type.
  @Qualifier annotation: Differentiates between the other beans by providing a unique qualifier name.
  
### Spring Conditional Annotations
  Institiates a bean of a specific implementaion of an interface under certian conditions.
  For instance, If using Oracle database, then create DaoOracle. If using Informix database, the create DaoInformix.
  
  In pre-Spring era, one may pass the database flag as a commanline parameter, for instance,
    if (args[0].equals("oracle") {
      dao = new DaoOracle();
    } else if (args[0].equals("informix") {
      dao = new DaoInformix();
    } else {
      throw new ApplicationException("Unsupported database:" + args[0]);
    }
  
  Either way, one asks the question: "Is it the Oracle database?" only once, at the application startup time.
